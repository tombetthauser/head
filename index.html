<!-- 		<p>RT: Because we don't retain any recorde from the previous state we can't form any conclusions about the meaning of the state as it's currently observed. That's the conclusion many of us have come to and so we have transitioned to focus our efforts on establishing an internal logic to the present state and acting within the structure that that provides.</p>

		<p>LT: But the interesting point that this brings up from our perspective is that the internal logic of the present state seems to logically bottle-neck to an investigation of the previous state.</p>

		<p>RT: This actually is an inversion of what we've generally observed. It seems that generally the previous state is almost never treated with serious concern, rather the following state - which appears to be an inevitable transition in all of our observations - is the overwhelmingly dominant consern. This seems to be based again on the internal logic dictated by the natural experience of time. Of course we can't and probably should not make any assumptions about the operational logic of time in either the previous or following states. Even our own observations of time seem less consistant than is often assumed, although it's fundamental linear nature is of course consistant.</p>
